# Home EEG

Resistors + capacitors + hardware processing
What time/day of the week works?
  Thursdays(lateafternoons + evenings) and Saturdays (Eden only every second Saturday)
      Alternate between Thursday and Saturday

What did you learn about the process of developing EEG products from muse, can we still develop software for Muse? SDK is gone

### ADD ONS
6+ electrodes
fancy case
plugins for other components - USB HUB with markers for setting tags (Keyboard(which buttons), Cursor (x,y)) 
On the input computer - an LSL backend that configures the following plugins into a single stream with unique triggers and then has the option of splitting apart
- skin conductance
- Homemade eye tracking
- mouse/cursor/keyboard tracking
- Homemade EEG

## Preliminary Project
Security Camera
servos (2)
native pi cam
opencv

### ADD ONS
Upload to server
Automatic body tracking and scanning field
More than one camera per Pi
More than one Pi per server
Use a nightvision when regular camera feed in ineffective, vice versa
Have an option to remote view, from outside local network (static IP)
Ability to control camera motion manually and focus in on a spot
Adapt motion OS
Streamline GUI
